Choose a suitable dataset from [this](https://github.com/HAN-M3DM-Data-Mining/assignments/tree/master/datasets) folder and train your own kNN model. Follow all the steps from the CRISP-DM model.

## Business Understanding

This assignment is based on the data and story of Georg Hoffmann, Andreas Bietenbeck, Ralf Lichtinghagen and Frank Klawonn [@hoffmann2018].

When laboratory have to make a diagnose, their way of making decisions is based on rules: "If...then...else". This way of diagnosing can be seen as a decision tree. Those treebranches can be seen as established medical guidelines that lead at some point to a diagnosis, like shown in the example down below.

This data problem is about creating a KNN model that can determine whether a patient needs a liver transplantation or not.

The data for this study is based on 73 patients (52 males, 21 females), aged 19 to 75 years (median 50), with a proven serological and histopathological diagnosis of hepatitis C. Who have suffer a chronic hepatitis C infection without fibrosis to end stage liver cirrhosis with a need for liver transplantation (LTX).
